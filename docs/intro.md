# GitHub is awesome

You have an awesome project, hosted on an awesome DVCS service, with an awesome readme.

That readme is written in an awesome text-based format, and awesomely rendered by the awesome DVCS service.

## But there's a problem

Even if your markdown-fu is on par with John Gruber's, GitHub has custom markdown extensions.  That's a lot of awesome syntax, and it can be ~~awesome~~ hard to remember it all.

All GitHub comment areas have a nifty "preview mode", sure.

**But there's no way to preview a readme.**

## This is (one of) the solution(s)

Markdown on the left.  Preview on the right.  It's just that simple.
